# ZANAPRESS (ZP)
ZANAPRESS (ZP) is an adapter to use WordPress themes (WPTA) to create small websites that don't need to be maintained.

The websites consist of one php-file each, which you can adapt directly in the text editor of your choice. ZP is not a CMS. You simply create a PHP file, which then populates the design (theme) of your choice, e.g.

```php

//$noindex=true; // do you want this page to be indexed by robots?

// define content
$GLOBALS['zdata']=[
    'title'=>'', /*can be empty*/ 
    'h1'=>'Home', 
    'body'=>"<p>Create small web sites with ZANAPRESS that do not need to be maintained.</p>
<p><a href='contact.php'>Contact Us ></a></p>",
    ];

// output page
include_once('./zp/zana.php'); // run ZP
out_page(); 
```
## Initial setup

- Download the ZP archive, unzip it and upload it to your website
- Download the minnow theme either from the wordpress or github website and put it the following directory "./layout/minnow" (it doesnt matter if a theme hasnâ€™t been updated for a long time). Use: https://wordpress.org/themes/minnow/ -or- https://github.com/theme/minnow-wpcom
- Keep the zana.css file in that directory (you can add and overwrite css declarations directly in this file). Thus you have to make less changes to the theme.
- Open your website and everything should run
