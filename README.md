# ZANAPRESS (ZP)
Man, I love WordPress and its designs, but sometimes a web site is just too tiny to run it with an instance of WordPress - all that updating of the plugins, the core, the themes... Instead I often use ZANAPRESS. 

ZANAPRESS (ZP) is an adapter to use WordPress themes (WPTA) to create small PHP websites that don't need to be maintained/updated. 

Each web page consists of one php-file, which you can modify directly in the text editor of your choice (ZP is **not** a CMS). You simply create a PHP file, which then populates the design (theme) of your choice with the given contents, e.g.

```php
<?php
//$noindex=true; // do you want this page to be indexed by robots?

// define content
$GLOBALS['zdata']=[
    'title'=>'', /*can be empty*/ 
    'h1'=>'Home', 
    'body'=>"<p>Create small web sites with ZANAPRESS that do not need to be maintained.</p>
<p><a href='contact.php'>Contact Us &gt;</a></p>",
    ];

// output page
include_once('./zp/zana.php'); // run ZP
out_page(); 
?>
```
## Initial setup

- Download the ZP archive, unzip it and upload it to your website
- Download the minnow theme either from the wordpress or github website and put it the following directory "./layout/minnow" (it shouldnt matter if a theme hasn’t been updated for a long time). Links: https://wordpress.org/themes/minnow/ -or- https://github.com/theme/minnow-wpcom
- Keep the zana.css file in that directory (you can add and overwrite css declarations directly in this file). Thus you have to make less changes to the theme.
- Open the footer.php file. You might want to delete everything between `<div class="site-info">` and `</div>` and replace it with the following:
`<?php echo $GLOBALS['zconf']['foot'][0]."  &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; ".$GLOBALS['zconf']['foot'][1]; ?>`
- Open your website and everything should run like in this screenshot:

| ------ |

- Now you can change the ./zp/_conf.php file to modify your navigation and footer and place new web pages in the root directory.
```php
	,'navi'=>array(
		'index'=>array('Start', './')
		,'test'=>array('Test', 'test.php')
		,'kontakt'=>array('Kontakt', 'kontakt.php')
		)
	,'foot'=>array(
		0=>"<a href='impressum.php'>Impressum</a> • <a href='datenschutz.php'>Datenschutz</a>"
		,1=>"<a href='http://www.example.com/' target='_blank'>Link</a>"
		)
```
