---This is the general scripts folder for ALL themes/layouts.


- Put every layout in its own folder, e.g. minnow, syntax. Change the footer.php and maybe functions.php according to your needs.

- If you dont want to load fonts and jquery from other website for privacy reasons do the following
a) Download the jquery files and put them into the ./layout/scripts/ folder. The ones you need you will find in the top of the file ./zp/zana.php. Just download them and keep the filename
b) The functions.php of your theme will tell you the fonts you need. Download all of them and store them in the ./layout/fonts/ folder. There you will find further instructions.
