---This is the general scripts folder for ALL themes/layouts.

- If you dont want the themes to load fonts and jquery from other website for privacy reasons do the following:

a) Download the used jquery files and put them into the ./layout/scripts/ folder. The files you need, you will find in the top of the file ./zp/zana.php. Just keep the filename

b) Additionally you have to download the fonts. The fonts the theme needs, you will find in the functions.php file of your theme. Download all of them and store them in the ./layout/fonts/ folder. See there for further instructions on this matter
