Download this theme "minnow" from wordpress or github and put it in this directory. (Is doesnt matter if the theme hasn’t been updated for a long time.)
Keep the zana.css file in this directory. You can add and overwrite css declarations changes directly in zana.css. Thus you dont have to edit the theme css.
