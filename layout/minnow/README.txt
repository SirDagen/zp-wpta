Download the theme "minnow" from wordpress or github and put it in this directory. (Is shouldnt matter if the theme hasnâ€™t been updated for a long time.)
Keep the zana.css file in this directory. You can add and overwrite css declarations changes directly in zana.css. Thus you dont have to edit the theme css.
